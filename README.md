# cmc-web-scrape

Web scraping CoinMarketCap's historical price data.

## Setup

1. Use `yarn` to install project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

> **Note**: This **uses** [yarn2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#per-project-install). However, you want to use `npm`, you can do so by running `npm i` instead of `yarn`, and remove the unnecessary yarn2 dependencies by running `rm -rf .yarn .yarnrc.yml .pnp.js`.

2. Use the yarn script in the `package.json`:

```bash
yarn testrun
```
